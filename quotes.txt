Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, itâ€™s bad.
First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.
Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.
Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.
Talk is cheap. Show me the code.
Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.
Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
Strive for clarity, not cleverness.
Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.
